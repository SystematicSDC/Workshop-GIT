# Workshop-GIT


1. Clone the repository
2. Create two branches (branch-your-name1/2 – so we avoid conflicts between branch names)
3. On the second branch create a new folder (folder-your-name)
4. On the second branch create a new text file inside that folder – add something in it
5. Commit the changes
6. Push the changes
7. Checkout the first branch
8. Merge/rebase your first branch with the other branch – you should now see your file
9. Change something in the file
10. Commit and push the changes
11. Move to the second branch
12. Change your file once again
13. Commit the changes
14. Merge/rebase with the other branch – it should trigger some conflicts
15. Solve the conflicts
16. WIN!
